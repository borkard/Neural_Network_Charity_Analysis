# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis used tensorflow to conduct a neural network analysis to predict where to make investments using a  charity dataset of 34,000 organizations that have received funding. The data was preprocessed and loaded into a neural network model, trained, and evaluated. The results of this analysis are below.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
* The target of this neural network model is whether or not the investment was successful and the money invested in the charity was used effectively.
* The features for this model were the application type and classification.
* The identification columns, EIN and Name, were not useful to this model and were removed.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* The initial model contained 2 layers with 80 neurons in the first, 30 neurons in the second, and both used the relu activation function. This choice was made to test out a standard model and identify areas for improvement.
* The initial model did not receive the target model performance of 75, but received 72% accuracy.
* To increase model performance, I tried increasing the number of hidden layers and number of neurons, changing the activation types, and increasing the number of epochs. All methods yielded an accuracy score around 72%.

## Summary 
The deep learning model was not optimized for optimal target performance to identify which charities to invest in. An SVM may have been a better model to solve this classification problem because it is intended to be a binary classifier and can conduct the same analysis without going very deep.
